# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Clean Code Architecture Compliance

- [ ] Functions and methods have single, well-defined purposes
- [ ] Variables and functions use clear, intent-revealing names
- [ ] Code is self-documenting (comments explain "why", not "what")
- [ ] No code duplication; proper abstractions in place
- [ ] Dependencies point inward: business logic independent of UI/infrastructure

**Violations**: [List any violations and justify why needed, or mark N/A]

### II. Frontend-Backend Separation Compliance

- [ ] Frontend code in dedicated frontend directories/projects
- [ ] Backend code in dedicated backend directories/projects
- [ ] Communication only through well-defined API contracts
- [ ] Frontend does not directly access backend data stores or business logic
- [ ] Backend agnostic to frontend implementation details

**Violations**: [List any violations and justify why needed, or mark N/A]

### III. Simplicity First Compliance

- [ ] Solution is the simplest that solves the actual problem
- [ ] Complexity is justified by real, concrete requirements
- [ ] No speculative features or premature future-proofing
- [ ] All patterns, frameworks, dependencies deliver clear value
- [ ] YAGNI principle observed

**Violations**: [List any violations and justify why needed, or mark N/A]

### Quality & Review

- [ ] Manual review process defined for this feature
- [ ] Review criteria clear and documented
- [ ] No automated testing infrastructure required (per constitution)

**Notes**: [Any additional quality considerations for this feature]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
